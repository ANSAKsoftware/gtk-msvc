# gtk-msvc

A project to package up gtk and its dependencies for use in an MSVC development environment.

## Prelude

Along with the GPL license on this work -- which is only repackaging other OpenSource packages, some of which are themselves under GPL -- please accept this blessing (acknowledging SQLite, from their [`LICENSE.md`](https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/blob/master/LICENSE.md?plain=1#L37-L39)):

* May you do good and not evil.
* May you find forgiveness for yourself and forgive others.
* May you share freely, never taking more than you give.

## Intro

A collection of build drivers to get `gtk` and its dependencies into a coherent place in a Windows Development Environment.

As has been done with `ansak-string`, `ansak-lib`, and `sqlite_msvc_packager`, this build driver enables an environment where
* all headers associated with `gtk` and its dependencies are placed in `C:\ProgramData\include`
* all link libraries, whether static-link or stub libraries to link to a `DLL` are placed in `C:\ProgramData\lib`
   * with separate sub-directories from `Release`, `Debug`, `RelWithDebInfo` and `MinSizeRel` where appropriate.

It uses python scripts, `configure.py` and `make.py` to simulate only loosely the standard commands and targets used in a typical `autoconf`/`automake`-driven build setup, selecting only to run python3. (`python2` is beyond deprecation now)

## Prerequisites

* A python interpreter. The one from [python.org](https://python.org) is recommended.
* Turn off Windows auto-redirect from `python` and `python3` to the app store ([here's how](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58754860/cmd-opens-windows-store-when-i-type-python) -- find the "App Execution Alias" image, should be in most-popular answer)
* update pip and install tools:
    * `python --version` -- to verify you have a "latest"-ish python3 installed
    * `python -m ensurepip --default-pip` -- to make sure pip is there
    * `python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel` -- to make sure the pip system is up to date
    * `python -m pip install patch pyyaml` -- to bring in a couple of tools the scripts depend on
* install gendef: it creates stub libraries for `.DLL` components whose build process doesn't itself produce `.LIB` files as part of their build. Recommendation is the [ansak packaged version](https://github.com/ANSAKsoftware/gendef-msvc) but any version of the GPL tool will do.
* if you use the ansak version of gendef, per s√©, you will want your `PATH` variable to include `C:\ProgramData\bin` -- or copy `gendef.exe` produced there to a `tools` directory on your system, whatever you happen to call it.
* install NSIS from [here](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download); prefer version 3.x or later

For build systems, you may want to do these inside a python virtual environment (`venv` -- iykyk). If you have no idea what I'm talking about there, you're probably okay just doing the above for now.

## Internals
What follows are implementation notes.

### `configure.py`

This script sets up a `configvars.py` file that drives the rest of the process

### `make.py`

Uses parameters to simulate `all`, `install`, `uninstall`, `package`, `clean`,
`scrub` (and `help`!) targets that a typical `autoconf`/`autobuild`-produced
`Makefile` would have.

### `build` directory structure

```
build ---+---source  -- contains the git-cloned sources for the packages that
         |                  go into gtk
         +---build   -- contains the per-package build sub-directories for each
         |                  package; for cmake-driven packages, this will be
         |                  the directory from which the command,
         |                  "cmake ../source/package/<wherever-the-source-cmake-file-is>"
         |                   is run
         +---include -- when packages are built, their include files go in here
         +---lib     -- when packages are built, their library files go in here
         +---bin     -- when packages are built, their binary files go in here
         +---staging -- when packages are built, this is where the files are
                            collected for putting into an install set
```
`lib` and `bin` will only contain Release libs and binaries.

#### under `build\build`

Each sub-directory under build will be per package and their contents will be
the results of whatever build-script is used to build that package.

Some packages produce (by defult) a `.DLL` without also producing an import
library. For these packages there will also be a `dll-work` sub-directory which
will be a place where `gendef` will be run in order to produce the `.LIB` file
that can be used by another target to link with.
